# INTRODUCTION AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
Weapons pose a significant threat to public safety and security. The ability to automatically 
identify and classify weapons in real-time is crucial for law enforcement agencies, security 
organizations, and public safety initiatives. Traditional methods of weapon detection heavily rely 
on manual inspection, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and potentially dangerous. To 
address these challenges, computer vision and machine learning techniques can be employed to 
develop an automated weapon classification system.
Gun violence in a lot of areas remains stubbornly high. Therefore, limiting gun violence has been 
a priority in recent years. In this report, we will be implementing the use of deep learning 
algorithms to classify any firearms or weapons, to improve response times and reduce potential 
harm. The proposed system in this report is a weapon classification model that makes use of 
tensorflow keras. The project will involve the use of various resources for implementation, such 
as : python, OpenCV ,GoogleColab, Numpy, Pandas, Matplot, Glob, etc.
The successful development of a weapon classification system can significantly enhance public 
safety and security. It can be deployed in various contexts, including airports, public events, 
transportation hubs, and high-security facilities, to detect and prevent potential threats, ultimately 
saving lives and reducing the risk of weapon-related incidents.
